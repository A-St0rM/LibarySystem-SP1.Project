# LibarySystem - SP1.Project

SP1 Project is the first coding project in 1. semester for the education. It has the following requirements: A small program in Processing that demonstrates your understanding of the fundamental programming elements. Your program should include the following:

1. Variables and Data Types: Use int, float, String, and data structures such as arrays (array[]) or ArrayList.

2. Conditionals: Implement if-else statements, relational operators (>, <, ==), and Boolean operators (&&, ||).

3. Loops: Use loops (for or for-each), for example, to iterate over an array or to make something happen repeatedly.

4. Custom Methods: Define your own methods, making use of parameters and the return keyword. Demonstrate that you can call these methods properly.

The task is open-ended, so you are free to decide what to code. This could be a graphic, an animation, a small game
